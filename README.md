# graphics_viewer

Graphic viewer is an [OpenGl](https://www.opengl.org/) based rendering system, which takes in [obj files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) 
and renders them on the viewer.

The different aspects of the system are: 

* Modeling- mathematical specification of shape and appearance

* Texture Mapping- allows gluing an image to the vertices

* Lighting and Shading

* Rendering

* University of Arizona walkthrough- 

The vertices of buildings at University of Arizona were defined in an obj file:

Model of Old Main:

The building were then texture mapped and rendered:

which is a model of the University of Arizona old main area:

The user can then zoom in and out and use the arrow keys to navigate through the University.
